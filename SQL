SQL injection is a hacking technique that was discovered more than fifteen years ago and is still proving to be devastatingly effective today, remaining a top database security priority. It was used in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election to compromise the personal data of 200,000 Illinois voters, as well as in high-profile attacks against organizations such as Sony Pictures, PBS, Microsoft, Yahoo, Heartland Payment Systems, and even the CIA.

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the command-and-control language for relational databases such as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and MySQL. In modern web development, these databases are often used on the back end of web applications and content management systems written in PHP, ASP.NET or other scripting languages â€“ meaning that both the content and behavior of many websites is built on data in a database server.
